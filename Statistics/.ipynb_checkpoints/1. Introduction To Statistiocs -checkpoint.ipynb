    "## Why median is used instead of mean.\n",
    "The median is often used instead of the mean in certain situations because it is less sensitive to extreme values or outliers in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean is a measure of central tendency that is calculated by adding up all the values in a dataset and dividing by the number of values. It is sensitive to extreme values because it takes into account all values in the dataset, regardless of how far away they are from the other values. As a result, the mean can be skewed or biased by outliers in the data, which can lead to incorrect conclusions or decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The median, on the other hand, is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in order. It is less sensitive to extreme values because it only takes into account the middle value(s) and ignores the values at the extremes. This makes it a more robust measure of central tendency that is useful when the data has outliers or when the distribution is skewed.\n",

    "The mode is typically used instead of the mean and median when dealing with categorical or discrete data, where the values represent categories or distinct groups rather than numerical values. In such cases, the mean and median may not be meaningful or relevant, as there is no inherent ordering or relationship between the categories."
